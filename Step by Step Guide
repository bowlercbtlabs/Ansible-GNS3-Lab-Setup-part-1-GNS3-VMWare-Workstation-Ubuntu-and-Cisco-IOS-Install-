Step By Step Guide:
*******

1) Download GNS3

https://www.gns3.com/software/download

2) Download and install VMWare Workstation:

https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html

3) Download and install Ubuntu:

https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop

- Add a 2nd interface to the ubuntu server, this will be for the connection inside GNS3

4) Download and install the GNS3 VM (MAY NOT NEED THIS STEP FOR THIS LAB):

https://gns3.com/software/download-vm

5) Download and install the Cisco Image in GNS3:

https://www.gns3.com/marketplace/featured/cisco-3725

- download the IOS image
- load the IOS image into GNS3 via 'new template' > 
  - then select 'install appliance from the GNS3 server' 
  - from dropdown select the appliance type "router/firewall" etc... then select the model type 
  - click 'install'
  - then select 'install the device on your local computer'
  - then import and select the appropriate version and file and select next
  - when asked to install the new device select 'yes'
  - you should now see the device added to GNS3 

6) Add the Ubuntu device to GNS3:

- Enable the GNS3 VM under Edit > Preferences
- Select the Ubuntu Server
- Under VMware Preferences
  - check the 'block network traffic originating from the host OS'
  - click the 'configure' box under vmnet2 to vmnet19 options. this will allow GNS3 to automatically configure the vmnet interfaces

7) Add the switch into GNS3
  - Add the 2nd port on the Ubuntu server to the switch
  - Add the 1st port on the routers to the switch


7) Enable SSH on the Routers:

ip domain name bowlercbtlabs
crytpo key generate-rsa 
ip ssh version 2
username steve privilege 15 password 0 password
line vty 0 4
 login local
 transport input ssh


8) Modify etc/ssh/ssh_config file to allow older version of ssh to work to connect to the Cisco routers:

sudo vi /etc/ssh/ssh_config (add following lines to end of file):

KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group1-sha1,curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,ecdh-sha2-nistp256,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp521,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1
HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa

9) Try to now ping and ssh from Ubuntu server to the routers:

ubuntu# ping 192.168.158.200 
ubuntu# ssh steve@192.168.158.200

10) Once we have reachability via ssh we can now start installing and creating ansible playbooks to push to our GNS3 clients
